# Introducing Python

This reprository aims to outline Python programming language in QGIS and keep it short and relevant to get solid foundation for visualizing and analyzing data.
QGIS 

PyQgis cookbook can be found here: https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/
Its great for users who does not have any prior programming knowledge and they want to build their knowledge gradually in QGIS.

# Object-oriented language - Python

Benefits: No need to declare variables types & it provides a great amount of python machine learning and analytical packages.

**Exploratory analysis of wild-fires in Australia & a machine learning approach 
for wildfire modeling in Google Earth Engine**

The free remotely sensed data allows analyzing this disaster and therefore this study investigates the Australian wildfires based data from Earth observation with the respect to uncovering the general insights. In the last few years, machine learning (ML) has proven to be successful in many domains due to the capability of learning also from hidden relationships. 

In this study, the overall objective is to create an automatized process of creating a fire training dataset at a continental level with an efficient computational expense for the ML algorithms. These results of fire occurrence locations and no-fire occurrence locations are mapped alongside with 15 fire causal factors. 

**The training dataset is applied to different ML algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF), Naïve Bayes, and Classification and Regression Tree (CART).**

All ML approaches were trained using 70% of the wildﬁre dataset and tested using the remaining 30% of the dataset. The ML algorithm with the best performance, the RF model, helps to identify the driving factors using variable importance analysis based on ML methods. Typically, this model can learn certain properties from a training dataset to make predictions. Thus, the results of this study disclose the fire occurrence probability in Australia as well as identified the driving factors and their dynamic influence on fire occurrence. Improved preventive measures can be implemented in the fire-prone areas to reduce the risk of fire in Australia by considering the factors identified in this study.
